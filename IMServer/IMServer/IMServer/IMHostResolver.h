/*
 You can use the object to map from a DNS name to a set of addresses or from a
 address to a set of DNS names.  To do this:
 
 1. create the IMHostResolver object with the info you have
 
 2. set a delegate
 
 3. call -start
 
 4. wait for -hostResolverDidFinish: to be called
 
 5. extract the information you need from the resolvedXxx properties
